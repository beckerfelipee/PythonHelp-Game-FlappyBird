# Flappy Bird in Python with Pygame

This repository contain a simple version of the Flappy Bird game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This game was created as part of the [Python Help](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770989141134671925/1160185849334464573/Python_help_-_Aulas_particulares.pdf?ex=6533be45&is=65214945&hm=677f726106df35d432bc6bc649894043d88e37f308f54047fed8e4c00b671dae&) project, aiming to teach students how to create games using Pygame.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience for students to learn game development concepts using Pygame. The game serves as a practical example covering various programming principles, from basic variables to object-oriented programming.

## Concepts Covered in the Code

The code encompasses a range of programming concepts, including:

- **Variables:** Used for tracking game state, such as score and time.
- **Loops:** Utilized for game updating and event handling.
- **Conditionals:** Employed for checking collisions, game over conditions, and scoring.
- **Functions:** Defined for modularizing code and improving readability.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The game design utilizes OOP principles with classes like `Pipe` for creating pipe objects, and `Bird` for managing the bird's behavior.
- **Event Handling:** Captures user input events to control the game.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine before running the game. You can install Pygame using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd PythonHelp-Game-FlappyBird
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Click the mouse to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles to score points.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` Contains the main implementation of the game.
- `assets/` Directory that stores game resources.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve or add features to the game, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the famous Flappy Bird game and was created with the goal of educating aspiring Python developers in game development using the Pygame library. Thanks to the open-source developer community for their contributions.

**Enjoy creating and playing games with Python! üê¶üéÆ**
